Search by Image
===============

**Search by Image** is a Safari extension that adds a few items to the context menu for images.  When right- or Control-clicking on an image, the context menu will contain two additional choices:

* Search by Image in New Window
* Search by Image in New Tab

Search Engine
-------------

Currently the only image search engine supported is Google Image Search.  Submit an enhancement request to [the GitHub project page](https://github.com/sethk/SearchByImage/issues).
